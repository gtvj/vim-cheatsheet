# vim-cheatsheet

This cheatsheet describes the Vim commands which I find most useful. It doesn't
describe the absolute basics or anything that's particularly advanced but should
be helpful to relative novices which are looking for tips to improve their
productivity. 

Please get in touch if anything doesn't make sense.
